# **This Repository is for Python and Data Science Projects**

- This repository contains a collection of Python scripts, mini-projects, and data science explorations.

- You'll also find exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. These projects demonstrate my ability to clean, visualize, and interpret data effectively to uncover meaningful insights.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!
